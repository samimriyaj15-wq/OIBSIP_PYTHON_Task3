# Advanced Random Password Generator

A desktop password generator built with Python and Tkinter. It uses Python's `secrets` module and includes configurable character types, password strength feedback, clipboard copying, persistent history, and light and dark themes.

## Features

- Generate secure random passwords
- Custom password length from 8 to 64 characters
- Supports:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
- Requires at least two character types, including uppercase letters
- Option to exclude ambiguous characters
- Password strength indicator and visual feedback
- Clipboard support through `pyperclip` with a Tkinter fallback
- Persistent password history using SQLite
- Keeps only the five most recently generated passwords
- History page with copy controls and a clear-history option
- Light and dark theme support
- Scrollable Tkinter interface
- No external database server required

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** — Graphical User Interface
- **SQLite** — Local password history
- **`secrets`** — Secure password generation
- **`string`** — Character sets
- **`pathlib`** — Database path management
- **`pyperclip`** — Preferred clipboard integration

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Tkinter (included with many Python installations; Linux users may need to install it separately)
- The Python package listed in `requirements.txt`

## Clone This Project

If you want to clone the repository and set it up with the GitHub remote:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SayanTheCoder/OIBSIP_Python_Task3.git
cd OIBSIP_Python_Task3
```

## Setup and Run

Open a terminal in this folder and run:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python random_pass.py
```

## Using the Application

1. Choose a password length between 8 and 64.
2. Open **Character Type** and select at least two types, including uppercase letters.
3. Optionally enable **Exclude Ambiguous Characters**.
4. Select **Generate Password**. The password is copied to the clipboard when clipboard access is available.
5. Use the copy control beside the password to copy it again.
6. Open **History** to review or copy one of the five most recent passwords, or clear the history.
7. Open **Settings** to switch between light and dark appearance modes.

## Password History and Privacy

The application creates `password_history.db` in this folder and stores the five most recently generated passwords there. This history persists between runs and is displayed in the History page. Use **Clear History** to delete the saved records.

The database contains passwords in readable form. Keep it private, do not share it, and store credentials in a trusted password manager. The database is excluded by `.gitignore` to help prevent it from being added to version control.

## Password Strength

The strength indicator is based on password length and the number of selected character types:

```text
Password condition                              Strength
-----------------------------------------------  --------
16 or more characters and 4 types               Strong
14 or more characters and at least 3 types      Strong
12 or more characters and at least 3 types      Medium
10 or more characters and at least 2 types      Medium
Other valid combinations                        Weak
```

## Project Files

`password_history.db` is created automatically when the application runs and is excluded from version control by `.gitignore`.
